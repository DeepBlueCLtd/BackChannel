# BackChannel

BackChannel is a lightweight plugin that brings structured review workflows to the disconnected web. Built for static HTML environments — including offline, secure, or air-gapped systems — it lets users capture, organize, and revisit feedback directly within the content they’re reviewing. Feedback is stored locally and can be exported as a human-readable CSV file, leaving it up to the user to transfer, process, or integrate responses however they choose. Whether you’re sharing documentation, training materials, or reference content offline, BackChannel gives you review tools for the disconnected web — with full control over how feedback moves.
