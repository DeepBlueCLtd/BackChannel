# Requirements: Create base CSS for badges, sidebars, buttons

## File Structure and Naming Convention
- CSS files will be stored alongside their respective component files
- Naming convention: `ComponentName.css` (e.g., `Badge.css`, `Sidebar.css`, `Button.css`)

## Components to Implement

  - Text badges with different colors

### 2. Sidebars
- Features to implement:
  - Fixed position sidebar option
  - Collapsible/expandable sidebar option

### 3. Buttons
- Single button style to be implemented initially
- Will be extended in the future if/when required

## Design System
- Create new color variables specifically for these components

## Browser and Device Compatibility
- Support modern browsers only:
  - Chrome
  - Firefox
  - Safari
  - Edge

## Testing
- Implement Playwright visual regression tests for these components

## Accessibility
- No specific accessibility requirements at this time

## Integration Plan
