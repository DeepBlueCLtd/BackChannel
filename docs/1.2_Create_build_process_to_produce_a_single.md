# Requirements: Create Build Process to Produce a Single-File JS Plugin

## Overview
This document outlines the requirements for creating a build process that produces a single-file JavaScript plugin for the BackChannel project.

## Build Output Requirements
- **Output filename**: `backchannel.js`
- **Output directory**: `/dist`
- **Package/module name**: `backchannel`
- **Build tool**: Vite (already configured in the repository)
- **API exposure**: The plugin will expose a `BackChannel` object with an `init(config)` method, matching the current codebase's API

## Technical Requirements
- **Module format**: ESNext (ESM)
- **Minification**: No minification; code should remain readable
- **Browser compatibility**: Modern browsers only
- **Usage method**: Script tag only (not as an importable module)
- **Source maps**: Should be generated for the output file

## API Structure
The plugin will maintain the existing API structure:
```javascript
// Example usage
BackChannel.init({
  requireInitials: true,
  storageKey: 'backchannel-comments'
});
```

## Implementation Notes
- The build process should bundle all necessary dependencies into a single JavaScript file
- TypeScript code should be transpiled to JavaScript
- The output should be a self-contained script that can be included via a script tag
- Source maps should be included to aid debugging
