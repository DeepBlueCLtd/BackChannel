# Requirements for Shared Types: Comment and FeedbackPackage

## Overview
This document outlines the requirements for the shared types needed in the BackChannel application: Comment and FeedbackPackage.

## File Location
- The shared types will be defined in: `src/types/index.ts`

## Type Definitions

### Comment
The Comment type represents feedback left on a specific element of a webpage.

**Properties:**
- `timestamp`: When the comment was created
- `xPath`: The XPath location of the element being commented on
- `elementText`: The text content of the element being commented on
- `feedback`: The actual comment/feedback text

**Notes:**
- All fields are required
- Comments are stored in their own table in IndexedDB

### FeedbackPackage
The FeedbackPackage type represents metadata about a collection of feedback for a website.

**Properties:**
- `rootURL`: The base URL of the website being commented on
- `name`: Name of the feedback package
- `author`: The person who created the feedback package

**Notes:**
- All fields are required
- FeedbackPackage does not include comments directly; comments are stored separately in IndexedDB
- In the IndexedDB, there is one table for Package containing a single row of metadata

## Implementation Considerations
- No additional supporting types/interfaces are needed
- All fields in both types are required (not optional)
