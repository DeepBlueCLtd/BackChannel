# Feature: Check if there is an active feedback package for this URL

## Overview
This feature determines if there is an active feedback package for the current URL using a caching strategy first, then falling back to searching all databases if no cache hit. It finds matching packages by checking if the current URL starts with a package's root URL (subpath matching). If a package is found, the system will display comments for that package and allow users to add new comments. If no package is found, the user will need to create one before capturing feedback.

## Technical Requirements

### File Location
- **File Path**: `src/services/db.js`
- **Service Type**: Backend service using IndexedDB with caching to localStorage

### Function Signature
```javascript
static async getActiveFeedbackPackageForUrl(currentUrl: string): Promise<{dbId: string, packageData: Object} | null>
```

### Input/Output
- **Input**: 
  - `currentUrl`: The URL of the current page (string)
- **Output**: 
  - A Promise that resolves to either:
    - An object containing the matching package data and its database ID
    - `null` if no matching package is found

### Behavior
1. Check localStorage for cached package information:
   - Look for `bc_root` and `bc_package` entries
   - If the current URL matches the cached root URL, retrieve the package from localStorage
   - Return the cached package data if found

2. If no cache hit or cache is invalid:
   - Use `DatabaseService.searchByUrl(currentUrl)` to search all BackChannel databases
   - This searches through all databases with the prefix 'bc-storage-'
   - For each database, retrieve its package and check if `currentUrl.startsWith(packageData.rootURL)`
   - Return the first matching package with its database ID
   - Cache the result in localStorage for future page loads

3. If no match is found, return null

4. If an error occurs at any step, log appropriately and return null

### Cache Management
- Cache package data in localStorage when found
- Clear cache when:
  - Creating a new package
  - Deleting a package
  - Updating package metadata

### Edge Cases
1. **Multiple Matching Packages**: Return the first match when multiple packages' root URLs match the current URL
2. **Cache Invalidation**: Ensure cache is invalidated when packages are modified or deleted
3. **URL Protocol Differences**: Handle URLs that differ only in protocol (http vs https)
4. **Browser Support**: Gracefully handle browsers without IndexedDB support
5. **Concurrent Database Operations**: Handle race conditions with proper transaction management
6. **No Matches**: Return null
7. **Database Error**: Handle gracefully and return null

## Testing Requirements
- Unit tests should be created to verify the function works correctly
- Test cases should include:
  - URL with a matching package
  - URL with no matching package
  - URL with multiple matching packages
  - Error handling when database access fails

## Integration Notes
- This function will be used by other components to determine whether to show comments or prompt for package creation
- The function is purely backend and does not directly manipulate UI
